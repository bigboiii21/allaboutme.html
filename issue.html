  Climate change is an issue that is progessively getting warmer. As humans keep abusing greenhouse gasses and polluting the beautiful earth,
  The tempatures keep rising and the earth is getting warmer. The rain will continue to increase as the cold weather continues to decrease.
  Which could affect the other living organisms besides humans. It is already affecting the polar regions and affecting the sea levels.
  We as humans have a responsiblity to take care of the earth before we all go extinct
